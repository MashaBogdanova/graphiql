      I am a junior front-end developer, and my professional journey
      has been far from straightforward. Just a few years
      ago, I immersed myself in the field of data analytics.
      Prior to that, I earned a degree in mathematics from
      Lomonosov Moscow State University. Now, I have found
      my true passion. Actively enhancing my expertise in web
      development, I started from the fundamentals of JavaScript
      and progressed to the point where I can design projects,
      break them down into tasks, write tests, and apply various frameworks.
      My team and I take great pride in the accomplishments we've
      achieved on this project!
